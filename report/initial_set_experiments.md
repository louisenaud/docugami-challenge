The first set of experiments aims at finding a good range for the number of clusters, and also a value for 
the dimensionality of the vectors that yields good results. 
Based on the results you can explore below, dimensionality 2 or 3, with a number of clusters ranging from 2 to 4 
seem to be yielding good results.
