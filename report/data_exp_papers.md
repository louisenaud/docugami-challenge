In order to cluster papers, we first need to know which data is available for all papers in xml file.
The following keys appear in all papers in the list, but only `titles`, `database` and `ref-type` are also non-null for every 
paper:
```json
{
  "n_papers": 1061, 
  "database": 1061, 
  "ref-type": 1061, 
  "titles": 1061, 
  "periodical": 1013, 
  "keywords": 140, 
  "urls": 956
}
```
